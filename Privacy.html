<p>      Thank you for using QR Code Sanner!    Here we describe what information we collect, why we collect it and how we handle it.  </p>
<h3>TL;DR</h3>
<p>    We collect anonymous statistics about your visit, like which pages you viewed.    Some 3rd parties like ad networks may know you visited this website.    We never share your data with 3rd parties except to help us deliver our services.    These are the key points, if you need detail, keep reading.  </p>

<p>    <em>Usage information.</em> When you use our services, we may automatically collect and    store    information in logs. This may include details how you use our services, your IP address,    system type or settings  </p>  <p>    <em>Google Analytics.</em>    We measure visitors to our website using Google Analytics. This records what pages you view    within our site, how you arrived at our site and some basic information about your    computer. All of that information is anonymous.

The information we collect from analytics helps us understand what parts of our sites are    doing well, how people arrive at our site and so on.

We do not collect, transmit or store any information you enter. The Code is generated directly    in the browser without transmiting any information to a remote system (that's why it also works    offline by the way).  </p>  <p>    <em>Dynamic QR Codes.</em>    Dynamic QR codes you create with our Service encode a static URL that points to the actual    content (for example the actual URL) hosted by our Services.    We store the content of your QR Codes on our Servers to deliver this Service.  </p>  <p>    <em>Scanning QR Codes.</em>    We do not collect, transmit or store any data from QR Codes you scan using our Services.    Scanning happens completely locally in your browser.  </p>  <h3>Children’s Privacy</h3>  <p>    Our Services are not intended for and may not be used by children under the age of 13.
