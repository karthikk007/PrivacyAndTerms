<div class="view-help text-view ng-scope" layout-padding="">  <p>    Thank you for using QR Code Scanner!    These terms of service (<em>Terms</em>) cover your use and access of our website, our    Chrome Extension    and related software (our <em>Services</em>). <br>    These Services are provided by alienlabs007@gmail.com (<em>we</em>,    <em>our</em>, or <em>us</em>).  </p>  <p>    By using our Services you agree these Terms and to review our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy    Policy</a>. If you do not agree to these Terms or our    Privacy Policy, you should not use our Services.  </p>  <h3>Software</h3>  <p>    Our Services may include web-based or downloadable software, which may update automatically on    your    device to newer versions.    We grant you a worldwide, non-exclusive and non-transferable to use the software solely to    use the Services.    Components of the software may be offered under an open source license, in this case we    will make that license available to you. Provisions of the open source license may expressly    override some of these Terms.  </p>  <h3>Changes to Services</h3>  <p>    We may change the features of our Services, withdraw or add new features form time to time.  </p>  <h3>Pricing</h3>  <p>    Our Services are offered for free. We fund this by ads that are shown solely on the generator    website.    We will never show any advertisement to users that scan your QR Codes.  </p>  <p>    <em>No scan limits and we'll play nice.</em>    We do not limit the number of scans of your dynamic QR Codes, nor will we ever ask you to pay    to keep your Dynamic QR Codes accessible.    We'll also never try to charge you for using your Services retrospectively in any other way    (which should go    without saying).    Note that static QR Codes are completely stand-alone, without any reference or    dependency on our Service. That's because they encode any content directly. So technically    they are completely indpendent from us, once created.  </p>  <p><em>Shutdown policy.</em>    If we should ever have to close this Service in the future, we'll give prominent notice on this    site at least 3 years before any dynamic QR Code becomes invalid.  </p>  <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>  <p>    To the fullest extend permitted by law, in no event shall we be liable for    any damages or loss of data, business, profits, computer hardware or software.    In no event shall our liability to you exceed the greater than 20 EURO or the amounts paid    by you to us for the past 12 months.  </p>  <h3>Warranties</h3>  <p>    We strive to provide good Services and hope you enjoy using them. But there are things we    cannot guarantee.    We provide our Services "As is". To the fullest extend permitted by law, we make no    warranties    either implied or expressed about    the Services. We do not make any promise about the specific functions of the services,    their    reliability or availability.</p>  <h3>Changes to Terms</h3>  <p>    We reserve the right these Terms at any time. We will always post the most current version    on our website.    By continuing to use the Services after the changes become effective, you agree to the    revised Terms.  </p></div>
